## Input 1

Can you also write some documentation for `weights_between_dates_with_interpolation` ?

## Output 1

Sure, here's an example of what the documentation could look like for the weights_between_dates_with_interpolation function:

```rust

/// Returns a vector of weights between two given dates, with additional interpolated weights added
/// to fill gaps between the actual weights. The interpolated weights are calculated by linearly
/// interpolating between adjacent actual weights.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `conn` - The connection to the SQLite database
/// * `start_date` - The starting date for the weight range (inclusive)
/// * `end_date` - The ending date for the weight range (inclusive)
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A `QueryResult` with a vector of tuples, where the first element of the tuple is a `Weight`
/// struct representing the actual or interpolated weight, and the second element is a boolean
/// indicating whether the weight is interpolated or not.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use rs_weight_tracker::{establish_connection, Weight};
/// use chrono::{NaiveDate};
///
/// let mut conn = establish_connection();
/// let start_date = NaiveDate::from_ymd(2021, 1, 1);
/// let end_date = NaiveDate::from_ymd(2021, 1, 31);
///
/// let weights = rs_weight_tracker::weights_between_dates_with_interpolation(&mut conn, start_date, end_date);
/// ```
///
/// This will return a vector of weights between the 1st and 31st of January 2021, with additional
/// interpolated weights added to fill gaps between the actual weights.
```

## Analysis 1

In rust, the comments represent actual code which also gets compiled. The code needs to be updated a bit.

```rust
/// ```rust
/// use rs_weight_tracker::Weight;
/// use chrono::{NaiveDate};
///
/// let mut conn = rs_weight_tracker::establish_connection();
/// let start_date = NaiveDate::from_ymd(2021, 1, 1);
/// let end_date = NaiveDate::from_ymd(2021, 1, 31);
///
/// let weights = rs_weight_tracker::weights_between_dates_with_interpolation(&mut conn, start_date, end_date);
/// ```
```

## Input 2

In `add-weight.html` when I try specifying the weight as a floating point number, it is considered invalid. Only integers seem to be accepted. What would I need to change to also use floating point numbers ?
Note, this is the current html content:

(Note: I actually hit Enter, instead of pasting the content, so ChatGPT only estimated the HTML based on what it remebered it should be)

## Output 2

In the HTML code, the weight input field has its type set to number, which is a field that only accepts integers. To allow the user to enter floating point numbers, you need to change the type attribute of the input element to text and add a pattern attribute that defines the pattern of the input. Here's an updated version of the HTML:

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Add Weight</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form>
      <label for="weight-value">Weight Value:</label>
      <input type="text" id="weight-value" name="weight-value" required pattern="^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$"><br>

      <label for="measurement-date">Measurement Date:</label>
      <input type="date" id="measurement-date" name="measurement-date" required><br>

      <button type="submit" id="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>

    <script>
      const form = document.querySelector('form');

      form.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();

        const weightValue = document.getElementById('weight-value').value;
        const measurementDate = document.getElementById('measurement-date').value;

        const payload = {
          weight_value: parseFloat(weightValue),
          measurement_date: measurementDate,
        };

        fetch('/api/add_weight', {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
          body: JSON.stringify(payload)
        })
          .then(response => response.json())
          .then(data => {
            console.log(data);
          })
          .catch(error => {
            console.error(error);
          });
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

In the updated version, the type attribute of the weight input field is set to text, and the pattern attribute is set to a regular expression that matches floating point numbers. The regular expression matches integers as well, so it still allows the user to enter integers. The parseFloat() function is used to convert the weight value to a floating point number before sending it to the server.

## Input 3

Thanks. How would I display a favicon from another location (a subdirectory on the server (<https://server.address/subpath1/favicon1.ico>) in a page ?

## Output 3

You can display a favicon from another location using the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section of your HTML document, like this:

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My Page</title>
    <link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="https://server.address/subpath1/favicon1.ico" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

The href attribute in the `<link>` tag specifies the URL of the favicon. The type attribute specifies the MIME type of the icon, which should be image/x-icon for ICO files.

Note that some browsers may not display the icon if it is located on a different domain or if it is not in the root directory of the domain. In those cases, you may need to configure your server to serve the favicon from the root directory, or use a different icon format, such as PNG or SVG.
