# 2023.02.21 ChatGPT session 1

## Input 1

Hi ChatGPT, please help me expand my Rust application.
The Rust application is using the Diesel crate with SQLite, so my Cargo.toml file looks like this:
```toml
[dependencies]
chrono = "0.4.23"
diesel = { version = "2.0.3", features = ["chrono", "sqlite"] }
dotenv = "0.15.0"
rusqlite = { version = "0.28.0", features = ["bundled"] }
```
I want to use the application to store weights. I think the Weight model should contain a weight and a measurement date.
Please suggest:
- the commands to run for the migration
- the up.sql
- the down.sql content

## Output 1

Sure, here's an example of how you can add a Weight model to your Rust application that uses Diesel with SQLite:

    Define the Weight model in a new file models.rs:

```rs
use chrono::{NaiveDate, NaiveDateTime};

use super::schema::weights;

#[derive(Queryable, Insertable, Debug)]
#[table_name = "weights"]
pub struct Weight {
    pub id: Option<i32>,
    pub weight: f64,
    pub measurement_date: NaiveDateTime,
}

impl Weight {
    pub fn new(weight: f64, measurement_date: NaiveDateTime) -> Self {
        Self {
            id: None,
            weight,
            measurement_date,
        }
    }
}
```

Here we define a Weight struct with an id field (which is an optional integer because it's generated by the database), a weight field of type f64, and a measurement_date field of type NaiveDateTime from the chrono crate.

    Add a new file schema.rs with the following content to define the weights table:

```rs
table! {
    weights (id) {
        id -> Nullable<Integer>,
        weight -> Double,
        measurement_date -> Timestamp,
    }
}
```

Run the following command to generate a new migration file:

```sh
diesel migration generate create_weights
```

Edit the generated migration file in the migrations directory to include the new table

```sql
-- up.sql
CREATE TABLE weights (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    weight DOUBLE NOT NULL,
    measurement_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

-- down.sql
DROP TABLE weights;
```

Run the migration with the following command:

```sh
diesel migration run
```

That's it! You should now have a weights table in your SQLite database that you can use to store weight measurements. You can add, update, and delete weights using Diesel's query builder API.

Here's an example of how to insert a new weight record into the database:

```rs
use diesel::{prelude::*, SqliteConnection};

fn add_weight(conn: &SqliteConnection, weight: f64, measurement_date: NaiveDateTime) -> Result<(), diesel::result::Error> {
    let weight = Weight::new(weight, measurement_date);
    diesel::insert_into(schema::weights::table)
        .values(&weight)
        .execute(conn)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

## Analysis-1

Some issues with compiling the code

#[table_name = "weights"] is no longer valid.

Also, id should not be nullable

## Input 2

I want to use the newer `table_name` notation in Diesel, which instead of this
```rs
#[derive(Queryable, Insertable, Debug)]
#[table_name = "weights"]
pub struct Weight {
    pub id: Option<i32>,
    pub weight: f64,
    pub measurement_date: NaiveDateTime,
}
```
would use this
```
use diesel::prelude::*;

#[derive(Queryable, Insertable, Debug)]
#[diesel(table_name = weights)]
pub struct Weight {
    pub id: Option<i32>,
    pub weight: f64,
    pub measurement_date: NaiveDateTime,
}
```

Please make the `id` field non-nullable and provide me with the new code for 
- up.sql
- down.sql
- models.rs

## Output 2

Sure, here's an updated version of the code using the newer diesel notation for specifying the table name, with a non-nullable id field:

    Define the Weight model in a new file models.rs:

```rs
use chrono::{NaiveDate, NaiveDateTime};
use diesel::{prelude::*, Queryable};
use super::schema::weights;

#[derive(Queryable, Insertable, Debug)]
#[diesel(table_name = "weights")]
pub struct Weight {
    pub id: i32,
    pub weight: f64,
    pub measurement_date: NaiveDateTime,
}

impl Weight {
    pub fn new(weight: f64, measurement_date: NaiveDateTime) -> Self {
        Self {
            id: 0,
            weight,
            measurement_date,
        }
    }
}

```

Here we define a Weight struct with a non-nullable id field of type i32, a weight field of type f64, and a measurement_date field of type NaiveDateTime from the chrono crate.

    Add a new file schema.rs with the following content to define the weights table:

```rs
table! {
    weights (id) {
        id -> Integer,
        weight -> Double,
        measurement_date -> Timestamp,
    }
}
```

Run the following command to generate a new migration file:

```sh
diesel migration generate create_weights
```

```sql
-- up.sql
CREATE TABLE weights (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    weight DOUBLE NOT NULL,
    measurement_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

-- down.sql
DROP TABLE weights;
```

Run the migration with the following command:

```sh
diesel migration run
```

That's it! You should now have a weights table in your SQLite database that you can use to store weight measurements. You can add, update, and delete weights using Diesel's query builder API.

Here's an example of how to insert a new weight record into the database:

```rs
use diesel::{prelude::*, SqliteConnection};

fn add_weight(conn: &SqliteConnection, weight: f64, measurement_date: NaiveDateTime) -> Result<(), diesel::result::Error> {
    let weight = Weight::new(weight, measurement_date);
    diesel::insert_into(weights::table)
        .values(&weight)
        .execute(conn)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

## Analysis 2

- the new sql up script is no longer with autoincrement.
- if we already executed migrations, we should run cargo redo. The instructions would be correct for new migrations, so we can ignore that.
- also, it does not learn about the new format.

## Input-3

I changed the `up.sql` migration script to:
```sql
CREATE TABLE weights (
    id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    weight DOUBLE NOT NULL,
    measurement_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```
I used the `down.sql` version you suggested.
The generated schema.rs looks like this:
```rs
diesel::table! {
    weights (id) {
        id -> Integer,
        weight -> Double,
        measurement_date -> Timestamp,
    }
}
```
I want you to provide me with an update to the `models.rs` file, where you also split the Weight struct into a 2 different structs: Weight and NewWeight, where NewWeight is the insertable version.

## Output-3

Sure, here's an updated version of the code that uses the modified migration script and splits the Weight struct into two structs:

    Define the Weight model and the NewWeight struct in new files models.rs and new_weight.rs:

```rs
// models.rs

use chrono::NaiveDateTime;
use diesel::prelude::*;
use super::schema::weights;

#[derive(Queryable, Debug)]
pub struct Weight {
    pub id: i32,
    pub weight: f64,
    pub measurement_date: NaiveDateTime,
}

#[derive(Insertable)]
#[table_name = "weights"]
pub struct NewWeight<'a> {
    pub weight: &'a f64,
    pub measurement_date: &'a NaiveDateTime,
}

impl Weight {
    pub fn new(id: i32, weight: f64, measurement_date: NaiveDateTime) -> Self {
        Self {
            id,
            weight,
            measurement_date,
        }
    }
}
```

```rs
// new_weight.rs

use chrono::NaiveDateTime;
use super::schema::weights;

#[derive(Insertable)]
#[table_name = "weights"]
pub struct NewWeight<'a> {
    pub weight: &'a f64,
    pub measurement_date: &'a NaiveDateTime,
}
```

Add a new file schema.rs with the following content to define the weights table:

```rs
table! {
    weights (id) {
        id -> Integer,
        weight -> Double,
        measurement_date -> Timestamp,
    }
}
```

Run the following command to generate a new migration file:

```sh
diesel migration generate create_weights
```

Edit the generated migration file in the migrations directory to include the new table:

```sql
-- up.sql
CREATE TABLE weights (
    id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    weight DOUBLE NOT NULL,
    measurement_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

-- down.sql
DROP TABLE weights;
```

Run the migration with the following command:

```sh
diesel migration run
```

That's it! You should now have a weights table in your SQLite database that you can use to store weight measurements. You can add, update, and delete weights using Diesel's query builder API.

Here's an example of how to insert a new weight record into the database using the NewWeight struct:

```rs
use diesel::{prelude::*, SqliteConnection};

fn add_weight(conn: &SqliteConnection, weight: &f64, measurement_date: &NaiveDateTime) -> Result<usize, diesel::result::Error> {
    let new_weight = NewWeight { weight, measurement_date };
    diesel::insert_into(weights::table)
        .values(&new_weight)
        .execute(conn)
}
```

## Analysis-3

The code for adding weight needs a bit of tinkering: the connection needs to be a mutable reference

```
fn add_weight(
    conn: &mut SqliteConnection,
    weight: &f64,
    measurement_date: &NaiveDateTime,
) -> Result<usize, diesel::result::Error> {
    let new_weight = NewWeight {
        weight,
        measurement_date,
    };
    use schema::weights;
    diesel::insert_into(weights::table)
        .values(&new_weight)
        .execute(conn)
}

## Input-4

It required a bit of tinkering. It seems that `add_weight` needs a mutable reference for the connection parameter. I created `lib.rs` and use the following code in it:
```rs
mod models;
mod schema;

use chrono::NaiveDateTime;
use models::{NewWeight};

use diesel::{prelude::*, SqliteConnection};

fn add_weight(
    conn: &mut SqliteConnection,
    weight: &f64,
    measurement_date: &NaiveDateTime,
) -> Result<usize, diesel::result::Error> {
    let new_weight = NewWeight {
        weight,
        measurement_date,
    };
    use schema::weights;
    diesel::insert_into(weights::table)
        .values(&new_weight)
        .execute(conn)
}

```

Keep this in mind as we expand this application

## Output-4

Thanks for the heads up and glad to hear you were able to make the necessary adjustments to the code.

And yes, I will keep that in mind as we expand the application. If you have any further questions or requirements, feel free to ask and I'll do my best to help you out.

## Input-5

Write a small command line binary to add a weight using the provided `add_weight` function from `lib.rs`.
It should receive 2 arguments: the weight to add and the timestamp.
I'll call this using:

```cmd
cargo run --bin add_weight [WEIGHT] [TIMESTAMP]
```

## Output-5

Sure, here's an example command line binary that uses the add_weight function to add a new weight record to the database:

    Create a new file add_weight.rs with the following content:

```rs
use chrono::NaiveDateTime;
use std::{env, error::Error};
use diesel::prelude::*;
use my_rust_app::{add_weight};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

    if args.len() < 3 {
        eprintln!("Usage: add_weight [WEIGHT] [TIMESTAMP]");
        return Ok(());
    }

    let weight = args[1].parse::<f64>()?;
    let timestamp = args[2].parse::<i64>()?;
    let measurement_date = NaiveDateTime::from_timestamp(timestamp, 0);

    let database_url = std::env::var("DATABASE_URL")?;
    let mut conn = SqliteConnection::establish(&database_url)?;

    let count = add_weight(&mut conn, &weight, &measurement_date)?;

    println!("Added {} new weight(s)", count);

    Ok(())
}
```

Here we use the env::args function to collect the command line arguments and parse them as a f64 weight and a i64 timestamp, which we convert to a NaiveDateTime using the from_timestamp function from the chrono crate. Then we establish a connection to the SQLite database, call the add_weight function with the weight and timestamp, and print the number of records that were added.

    Update the Cargo.toml file to include the new binary:

```toml
[[bin]]
name = "add_weight"
path = "src/add_weight.rs"

```

Run the binary with the following command:

```sh
cargo run --bin add_weight [WEIGHT] [TIMESTAMP]
```

Make sure to replace [WEIGHT] and [TIMESTAMP] with the actual values you want to add to the database. The timestamp should be in UNIX epoch time (i.e., the number of seconds since January 1, 1970).

That's it! You should now be able to add a weight to the database using the command line.

## Analysis-5

actually, a mistake from the previous step:
should be pub

```rs
pub fn add_weight(
    conn: &mut SqliteConnection,
    weight: &f64,
    measurement_date: &NaiveDateTime,
) -> Result<usize, diesel::result::Error> {
    let new_weight = NewWeight {
        weight,
        measurement_date,
    };
    use schema::weights;
    diesel::insert_into(weights::table)
        .values(&new_weight)
        .execute(conn)
}
```

did not use rest of cargo.toml changes

## next
pub fn establish_connection() -> SqliteConnection {
